I've found that one of the most effective levers to get higher quality work done more quickly is ensuring that **everyone on the team knows what they're responsible for and why**. By reviewing org structures, establishing goals, and by clarifying roles and responsibilities, it clears the way for people to focus on work that pushes the whole team in the same direction.
