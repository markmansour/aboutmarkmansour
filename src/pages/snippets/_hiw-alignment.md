I've found that when **everyone on the team knows what they're responsible for and why**, teams are more likely to run smoothly, deliver real value to customers, and reduce rework. By reviewing org structures, establishing goals, and clarifying roles and responsibilities, it clears the way for people to focus on work that pushes the whole team in the same direction.
