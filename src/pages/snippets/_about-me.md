Today I lead software engineering teams, but I started as a software engineer working on internet applications from the earliest days of the web. My day job was programming for the first ten years of my career, working on distributed systems in Java, C++, and Ruby before transitioning into being a people manager. I still enjoy programming and occasionally I scrape out  <a href="https://github.com/markmansour/" class="underline">time to write code</a>. But over the last ten years, I’ve been excited, challenged, and engrossed in learning about leadership and how to create high-performing technology teams.

<br/>

Looking forward, the people I work with are my top priority as I seek out new roles. I’m looking for an energetic group of people who play well together and enjoy each other’s company. This leads me to conclude that the product is really a secondary consideration, which means I'm open to working in nearly any type of product. That will come as a surprise to many, but if I put the people I work with first, then everything else must come after that. I’m a curious person and I love to learn new domains and technology. What I do look for in a product is that it has high growth potential and that leadership values that product.

If you’ve gotten this far, thank you.

Please reach out to me and say hello.
