I believe those closest to the work being done are in the best place to make decisions on how to do the work. My goal is to **delegate** as much as possible to my team while using check-ins to ensure we remain on course. Delegating authority can range from full delegation, where choices are left entirely to the team, to being quite directive. It all depends on the people and the circumstances. I work with my teams to clarify their purpose and the boundaries of their responsibilities so they are empowered to make decisions without me being in the room with them.
