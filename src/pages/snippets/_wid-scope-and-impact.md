Over the past 8 years I’ve led teams with two levels of managers reporting to me and a recursive team size of around 90. I’m based in Seattle and it’s common for me to manage teams spread across the US and internationally. My team’s products are often a significant piece of a larger product portfolio. In the past I’ve owned the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/" class="underline">Hybrid Identity features of Microsoft’s Entra ID</a>, the Prime / Checkout / Merchant portions of Amazon’s <a href="https://buywithprime.amazon.com/" class="underline">Buy With Prime</a> product, and Continuous Delivery, Automated testing, and Change Management tooling as part of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/developer-tools/" class="underline">Amazon’s Developer Productivity</a> at AWS. These systems process billions of records. I’ve owned fleets of over 80,000 machines, serving hundreds of thousands of QPS. On the business side, I lead and drive strategic plans for my area of ownership. I work closely with my stakeholders to influence their strategies.
