Over the past eight years, I’ve led teams with two levels of managers reporting to me, and a recursive team size of around 90. Based in Seattle, I frequently manage teams spread across the US and internationally. My team’s products are often a significant piece of a larger product portfolio.

In the past, I’ve owned the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/" class="underline">Hybrid Identity features of Microsoft’s Entra ID</a>, the Prime / Checkout / Merchant portions of Amazon’s <a href="https://buywithprime.amazon.com/" class="underline">Buy With Prime</a> product, and continuous delivery, automated testing, deployment governance, and change management tooling as part of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/developer-tools/" class="underline">Amazon’s Developer Productivity</a> at AWS. At their largest, these systems process billions of records a day. I’ve owned fleets of around 100,000 machines.

On the business side, I lead and drive strategic plans for my area of ownership, working closely with my stakeholders to influence their strategies.
