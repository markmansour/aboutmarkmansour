Mark was good at finding the balance of leaning in when I needed help and giving me lots of space to when I was doing ok (or when failure was an option).

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">About me</h2>
    <p>
      Today I lead software engineering teams, but started as a software engineer working on internet applications from
      the earliest days of the web. My day job was programming for the first ten years of my career working on
      distributed systems in Java, C++, and Ruby. I still enjoy programming and occasionally I scrape out time to write
      code. But over the last 10 years I&#8217;ve been excited, challenged, and engrossed learning about leadership and
      how to create high performing technology teams.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Looking forward, I know that the people I work with are my top priority as I seek out new roles. I&#8217;m looking
      for an energetic group of people who play well together and enjoy each other&#8217;s company. This leads me to a
      conclusion that the product is really a secondary consideration. That will come as a surprise to many, but if I
      put the people I work with first then everything else must come after that. I&#8217;m a curious person and I love
      to learn new domains and technology. What I do look for in a product is that is has high growth potential and that
      leadership values that product.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>If you&#8217;ve got this far, thank you.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Please reach out to me and say hello.
