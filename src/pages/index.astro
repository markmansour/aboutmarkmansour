I honestly didn't know what I was in for when I started the job, even though I had 7 years of experience there as an engineer.  Through Mark's guidance I learned how to communicate at an executive level. I learned how to manage large projects which had an impact across the entire company. Mark was good at finding the balance of leaning in when I needed help and giving me lots of space to when I was doing ok (or when failure was an option).  Ultimately I got promoted to Sr. Manager, and I never would have performed at that level without Mark's mentorship. I'm grateful to have had his help, and I think he would be a great leader on any team.`,
